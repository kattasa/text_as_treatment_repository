This needs to happen as soon as possible. The amount of gun violence that takes place in our country is disgusting. Gun ownership laws need to be more strict and there it no other way to go about this problem.

Those who are against stricter gun laws trample upon the rights of others who simply want to live without fearing for another mass massacre. The proliferation of guns and the rise in gun shootings have a direct relationship that is obviously overlooked by gun owners who do not support stricter laws on gun ownership. Restricting guns should be common sense and have no room for discussion.

Allowing everyone to own a gun is a disaster and more people will be killed unless we stop selling guns. The right of people to live without fear is more important than the right to bear arms. We've tried to allow gun ownership without much regulation and it doesn't work. It's time to restrict gun ownership.

The right to bear arms is in the constitution and too many people take it to heart. The saying goes that ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" is wrong. Individuals need to be banned from buying guns, even if they have committed no crimes, and we need to figure out how to remove guns if there is a ban."

Allowing everyone to own a gun is a disaster and more people will be killed unless we stop selling guns. The right of people to live without fear is more important than the right to bear arms. We've tried to allow gun ownership without much regulation and it doesn't work. It's time to restrict gun ownership.

I think that everyone should look at the science of climate change and think about how it may impact our own future and what we all experience. It is important for people to think of future generations rather than just ourselves. Because of this I think it is an important topic that needs to be discussed and studied.
